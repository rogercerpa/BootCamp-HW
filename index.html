                        It all started back in March 1990, at a hospital somewhere in Barranquilla, Colombia. The magic of always smiling, looking for the good out of any situation and that spirit of always growing personally and professionally has been around with me since day one. The fact that I'm into many random things, from Mountain Biking to reading philosophical books, from going on a Whole Food Plant-based lifestyle to studying web development, from doing photography to being the DJ at family gatherings, all those things play a crucial role in my life, as that's what feeds my soul, my spirit. It has been an amazing rollercoaster ride so far. As I'm always on the lookout for that next move, change and challenge to add to my life journey.

                                Roger Cerpa, a guy with a great attitude towards life, the one guy that is quiet and shy at first but that once you get to meet, will make you laugh from all the little silly things he does and says. Adventurous person, dedicated, passionate about learning and a really fun person to be around.
